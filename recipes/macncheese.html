    <h2>Macaroni and Cheese Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Boil Macaroni</h3>
    <p>
      Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente, about
      8 minutes. <b>Tip:</b> For a thicker mac and cheese, double the amount of
      macaroni.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2: Make a Roux</h3>
    <p>
      While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux. A roux is a
      thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up the
      base of this creamy mac and cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make the roux, start by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
      Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth. Slowly pour in milk and
      stir until the mixture is smooth and bubbling. Be careful to not let the
      milk burn.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3: Add Cheese and Macaroni</h3>
    <p>
      Finally, the most crucial step: Add cheese! Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese
      until smooth and melted. We recommend you grate your own cheese because
      pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well as block
      cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce
      until coated.
