    </p>
    <p>
      Begin by whisking the egg, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.
      Then, add the ground beef and bread crumbs before forming the mixture into
      ¾-inch patties. Place the patties on a preheated grill and cook for six to
      eight minutes per side.

      Make sure the beef's temperature reads at least 160 degrees F before
      serving, and you're ready to go. Top with classic condiments like mustard,
      ketchup, and mayo for full-fledged flavor.
